/legendify to make the held item legendary.
Legendary items gain a kill count in their lore section and are immune to natural despawning, degradation and destruction via survival means.

Known issues:
 - Legendary items thrown in lava or into a cactus do not render on the client's side, despite being there, and still retrievable.
 - The location of all dropped legendaries is periodically broadcast to the server, but this works with legendaries in loaded chunks. Potential workaround: send individual messages to players that are within range of legendary items.
